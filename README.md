- Chapter One: Big O Notation
  In computer science being able to write a solution for an interesting problem is one of the preliminary steps towards becoming an excellent computer scientist. The robustness of a solution that can handle and cover a vast range of cases is one feat of engineering but how do we measure if one solution is more performant as opposed to another solution. In computer science the efficiency of an algorithm is often analyzed in the amount of time & steps the algorithm takes to reach a certain result.

- Chapter Two: Problem Solving Techniques & Patterns
  Diving into coding the moment we lay our eyes on a problem statement can be very tempting at times but one can run into a dead end if one dives in without giving a considerable thought to what he is looking to solve. This chapter touches upon this problem that many programmer often find themselves stumbling across.
