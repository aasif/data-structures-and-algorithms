# Recursion

Recursion is an alternative of an iterative (looping) approach. This is a slightly confusing topic at first but once we get the hang of it, its really simple and efficient to use. Recursion is a pattern where a function calls itself (as opposed to some other function) until it gets to a solution.

There are only two things that a recursive function must have

1. A base condition: a stopping condition that tells the function when to stop and return result.
2. A call to itself (recursive call) with some different input
